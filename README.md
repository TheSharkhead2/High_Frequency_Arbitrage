This is a small simulation for a simple, coorperative stock trading situation. There are two players, each located at one of two different markets, and three stocks per location. Each tick, both players decide to sell one of the 6 stocks. If they sell in the market they are in, the sale will go through the next tick, if they sell in the other market, it will go through 8 ticks later. If the players sell stocks in different markets on any given tick, the payoff of that sale is normalized to 0. If they sell different stocks in the same market, each sale artificially increases the demand for the other stocks, meaning each player gets a positive m payoff. If they sell the same stock in the same market on any given tick, they compete against each other and get a negative payoff of M each. These payoffs are decided such that: 0 < m < M. What is the best strategy for each player such that they will get the highest payoff possible? 

My simulation allows for dynamic changing of the strategy for either player and for each player to be able to see the stock history based on their location. IE: they know all the stocks they have sold (or will sell with the delay), so they can see those, but if the other player sells in the other market, they won't see that for 8 ticks. This would be useful for various strategies that change based on sale history.
