This is a small simulation for a simple, coorperative stock trading situation. There are two players, each located at one of two different markets, and three stocks per location. Each tick, both players must sell one of three stocks (with equal probability, they don't necessarily sell the same stock) on either of their markets. Selling on one's own market means the transaction goes through in 1 tick. On the other market, it takes 80 ticks. If a sale of the same stock goes thorugh on the same market, both players get a -M payoff. It there are two different stocks in the same market, both players get +m payoff. 

I initially interpreted this problem as the players picking a market and then having a random stock assigned (this isn't quite right, but it is what I worked on). So I built a simulated annealing algorithm to decide on probabilities for either player to sell on their own market. I was unable to get conclusive results from this as it seemed to not perform that well in comparison to the 50-50 case or another simple case.
